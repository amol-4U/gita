                <p class="message">The modern trend of human civilization is supposed to be a polished type of animal life. It
                    has improved the method of eating by discovering varieties of palatable dishes. It has
                    improved the method of sleeping by constructing massive and attractive palatial buildings
                    and resting places, provided with well furnished coaches and sleeping bedsteads.
                    It has improved the quality of Fearing by various defence measures which are exacting
                    more than 50% of human energy with the ultimate result that it has invented the Atomic
                    Bomb which facilitates the dying process of human being. None of the scientific
                    discoveries can save the man from the cruel hands of death. It has improved the method of
                    sense-gratification by inventing cinometographic pictures, phonographic sounds, wireless
                    radios, horseless carriages and similar other illusory things on the one hand. On the other
                    hand it has improved the dressing method of the fair sex which gratifies the sense
                    enjoyment lust of human being. The market is full with the advertisements of pictures of
                    beautiful women for selling such sense gratifying articles as varieties of Toilets,
                    Jewelleries, Sarees, Medicines, contraceptives and similar other materials. And to maintain
                    this animal type of civilization for the benefit of a handful men of demoniac principles,
                    ninety-five percent people of the human race is chained up to become victims of this
                    wrong type of civilization, devoid of spiritual value.
                    There is no peace even now in the villagers' life because the innocent villagers are also
                    being attracted by the glamour of the polished type of animal civilization and that also for
                    the benefit of 5 percent contending polished demons. As such 95% of the innocent human
                    being is suffering from the pangs of this animal civilization.</p>
